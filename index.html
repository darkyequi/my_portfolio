            <p>I am an IT-focused developer and UI/UX designer with hands-on experience in building web and mobile applications. I have worked on academic and real-world projects involving system design, interface creation using Figma, functional testing, and bug fixing. My approach centers on creating user-friendly, efficient, and visually clean digital solutions.

I have experience collaborating on capstone projects such as order management systems, mobile-based applications, and information systems, where I contributed to UI/UX flow structuring, system testing, and feature improvements. I am detail-oriented and enjoy refining systems to improve usability, performance, and overall user experience.

Driven by continuous learning, I am always eager to expand my technical skills, explore modern design practices, and contribute to projects that solve real-world problems through technology.</p>
